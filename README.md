# React-Notes

1. This repository contains a summary outline I have worked on from time-to-time on the ReactJS framework. In addition to an outline prepared in markdown language, it contains sample projects illustrating the material in the outlines.

2. The nucleus of the materials in the repository are from multiple courses published by Stephen Grider on Udemy. They are fantastic explanations of React and related topics, such as Redux, *etc*. I highly recommend them to those who desire a thorough, but approachable, introduction to React.

3. **Important Note**: The materials herein are prepared for my personal use only, and I take no responsibility for their accuracy, and in some cases portions may not have been well-checked for typos and other mistakes.  It should also be kept in mind that my two aims in creating the outline, creating a useful reference and helping myself learn the concepts involved more fully by having to explain them in writing, are geared toward my personal situation. Parts may be glossed over because I already know the material well, or may be belabored if the concepts are new to me, and thus might prove less than useful to another person of different experience.

4. For any of the projects contained in the *apps* directory, it will be necessary to take the following steps to get them up and running:

    a. it is assumed that you have installed NodeJS and node package manager. If not, or if your version of NodeJS is not up-to-date, you must update and install it.

    b. in the directory in which the app code is located, in the terminal enter the command **node install**.
    
    c. when that is complete, type the following command from the project root directory in the terminal, **npm start**.
    
    d. go to **localhost:8080** in your browser to see what the app does.
